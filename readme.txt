WP Fanfiction and Writing Archive turns WordPress sites into online writing communities for fanfiction, longread, education, magazine, and more. Writers can create single stories or books with chapters to share with readers. Powerful search, and terrific tools for both writers and readers. Turn a blog into an online writing community.

WP Fanfiction and Writing Archive (WP FFWA) allows you to have a multi-author fanfiction repository of stories. Crowd source fanfiction for just one fandom or hundreds of fandoms. 

If you are building a social networking site for any movie, TV show, book, cartoon, comic, anime, manga, play, musical, WP Fanfiction and Writing Archive is the perfect addition for your site. Invite your site members to become active participants on your site by submitting fanfiction. WP Fanfiction and Writing Archive encourages both user-generated content and interaction between your site members. When using the premium “Favorites” plugin, site members can follow their favorite authors and receive updates when new stories are posted. 

A must have for any fan site, WP Fanfiction and Writing Archive will help you engage your site members by inviting a multi author community of fanfiction writers. Unlike a blog, where stories are stored in chronological order, your fanfic writing archive will make search easy for your site members. Each writer will have their own library of stories. 

WP Fanfiction and Writing Archive PREMIUM allows site admins to re-label fields so that the plugin can be used for any type of writing, not solely fanfiction.  The plugin is ideal for education sites including those using WP Courseware, LearnDash, LifterLMS, WPLMS, and Sensei. Working with course management and learning management plugins, you can create online courses for any discipline in which students submit writing of any kind. 

WP Fanfiction and Writing Archive PREMIUM is also ideal for any news, magazine, or journalism sites.

Additionally, WP Fanfiction and Writing Archive PREMIUM is a perfect solution for #longread sites.

Example: http://lesfan.com/fan-fiction/fandom/the-l-word/
“fan-fiction” is the name of the archive;  “fandom” is the name of the category; “the-l-word” is an item in the category – this page displays all stories uploaded to this item in the category
